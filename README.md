## 📖 About This Project

This is a **student learning project** where I recreated the American Horror Story: Hotel intro sequence. I built everything from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no frameworks or libraries allowed!

**Original Intro:** [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScY179qa5pM)

**Assignment:** Recreate a movie/TV/game intro using only vanilla web technologies

## ✨ What I Built

- 70+ horror scenes with image transitions
- CSS animations (flickering, zooming, fading)
- Blood drip effects (pure CSS!)
- Horror aesthetic (film grain, scanlines, vignette)
- Screen glitch effects
- Shadow animations
- Cast name overlays
- Background music (Web Audio API)
- Custom loading screen
- Keyboard controls (R to reset, Space to start)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Animations, transforms, keyframes
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - DOM manipulation, Web Audio API
- **CSS Variables** - Dynamic theming
- **Keyframe Animations** - Complex multi-step animations

## 🎨 Key Techniques Demonstrated

### CSS Skills
- `@keyframes` animations (10+ unique animations)
- CSS transforms (rotate, scale, translate)
- Position (fixed, absolute, relative)
- Flexbox centering
- Opacity and visibility transitions
- Text shadows and glowing effects
- Custom animation timing functions

### JavaScript Skills
- DOM selection and manipulation
- Event listeners (click, keyboard)
- `setInterval()` for timing control
- Web Audio API
- CSS class toggling
- Array iteration
- Function declarations and callbacks

## 📚 What I Learned

This was my first time building something like this! I learned:

- How to create complex CSS animations with `@keyframes`
- Using JavaScript to control timing with `setInterval()`
- DOM manipulation (selecting elements, adding/removing classes)
- Web Audio API for playing background music
- CSS positioning (fixed, absolute, relative)
- How to sync animations with music
- Organizing a bigger project with multiple files
- Debugging in browser console

## 🎯 Assignment Requirements

This was a school assignment with specific rules:
- ✅ No frameworks (no React, Vue, etc.)
- ✅ No libraries (no jQuery, GSAP, etc.)
- ✅ Only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ✅ Must work on desktop (1920x1080)
- ✅ Chrome/Brave browser

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Add more CSS filters (blur, contrast, noise)
- [ ] Implement canvas-based effects
- [ ] Add more transition types
- [ ] Fine-tune timing to match original exactly
- [ ] Optimize image loading with lazy loading
- [ ] Add mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Create video export functionality
